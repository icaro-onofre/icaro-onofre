### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
As you may know my name is Icaro Onofre Silva(Icaro as in the myth Icarus!), 
I am an enthusiast of computers and computer programming and I am currently working as 
a full stack developer. I have a couple of projects that vary acording to which is 
main motivation at the moment, check out my portifolio and see the main repos of my github!
I always summarize the scope, technologies, solution and the problem that I am dealing in the
project in the README of the project.
